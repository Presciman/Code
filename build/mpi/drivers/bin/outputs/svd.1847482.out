The global dimensions of the processor grid
- Grid dims = 4 2 2 

If true, automatically determine rank; otherwise, use the user-defined ranks
- Automatic rank determination = true

Used for automatic rank determination; the desired error rate
- SV Threshold = 0.01

List of filenames of raw data to be read

Threshold for standard deviation before we simply set it to 1
Used in StandardCentering scaling
- STD Threshold = 1e-09

If true, perform ST-HOSVD

If true, write the preprocessed data to a file
- Write preprocessed data = false

File containing a list of filenames to output the scaled data into
- Preprocessed output file list = pre.txt

If true, record the result of ST-HOSVD (the core tensor and all factors
- Write STHOSVD result = true

Directory location of ST-HOSVD output files
NOTE: Please ensure that this directory actually exists!
- STHOSVD directory = compressed_baryon_density
